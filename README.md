## Statement of work

**You can find the complete statement of this work, in the last point of this document with the title (FINAL WORK: JAVASCRIPT).**

**'It is important to note that this is a fictional project used for educational and practice purposes'**

## Characteristics

**Does not use a database**: It is important to note that this project does not have a database. The data collected in the quote form is not permanently stored anywhere. This is simply a form simulation.

**Server requirements**: For its correct operation, the project must be executed from a server. For example, it is recommended to use XAMPP or another local server to host the application. This is essential so that certain features, such as the news section that uses requests, can be displayed correctly.

## Download and Configuration in Local Environment

**Requirements:**
Have installed on your PC: A local server of your choice (XAMPP is recommended).

**Steps:**

1. **Download the Project:**
Click the "Code" button in this repository and select "Download ZIP".

2. **Project Extraction:**
Create a new folder on your desktop.
Go to the downloads folder and drag the downloaded ZIP file to the new folder to extract it.

3. **Location on Local Server:**
Copy the extracted project folder and paste it into the folder on your local server. For example, in XAMPP, the folder is usually xampp/htdocs.

4. **Start Local Server:**
On Windows, access the XAMPP Control Panel from the start menu (Start > XAMPP > XAMPP Control Panel) and run it as administrator to ensure you have the necessary permissions. Start Apache from the control panel by pressing Start.

5. **Project View:**
Open your web browser and navigate to (localhost/put here the folder name of the extracted project), this will load the project in your browser and you can interact with it locally. Once the project has been displayed, the icons at the top right for navigation between sections of the home page may not initially be displayed. To do this, once the project is displayed, update and refresh the browser first and the icons will appear in their place. This is a small problem that I have to solve when I can.
